In this directory you'll find the source code for GNU Go 2.6.1
for the PocketPC. It was developed in C/C++ with Microsoft
eMbedded Visual Tools 3.0. Yes, the program was called
Helloworld, as the file names suggest. Helloworld.cpp is the
main code file. There is not much documentation besides
my comments in the code, and those of the GNU Go 2.6 developers.
I have enclosed the file Documentation (no extension, comes
from Unix) from the original authors of GNU Go 2.6. It gives you
a clue for what different routines do; some I may have modified
or erased, and maybe the description is inaccurate. To modify
this program, you need to know C/C++, and the Win32 API.
Knowledge of the Windows CE platform, or at least Windows 9x/NT
is important.

Since this program is free software, I am not providing any sort
of support for it, and won't be able to answer many
technical questions about the code or the software/hardware 
platforms.

If you are interested in working on GNU Go to the PocketPC,
let me know, esp. if you are in the Boston area, USA.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Your suggestions for bug fixes and future versions will be 
appreciated. Enjoy the game!
